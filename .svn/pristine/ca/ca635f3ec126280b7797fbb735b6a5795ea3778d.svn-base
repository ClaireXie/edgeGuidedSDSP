% INTEGRALIMAGE - computes integral image of an image
%
% Usage:  intim = integralimage(im)
%
% This function computes an integral image such that the value of intim(r,c)
% equals sum(sum(im(1:r, 1:c))
%
% An integral image can be used with the function INTEGRALFILTER to perform
% filtering operations (using rectangular filters) on an image in time that 
% only depends on the image size, irrespective of the filter size.
